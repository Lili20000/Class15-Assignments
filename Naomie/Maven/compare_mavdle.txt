# This file compares the software tools Maven and Gradle

Gratle:
Gratle is an open tool that helps to build software. It's a high perfomance tool that is used on Java and DSL for project structure.
Gratle suports the creation of applications and testing on a lot of platforms.
It is a tool that is highly used with great functionality and provides a good variety of IDEs for pro users. With the amount of complexity Gradle
contains how ever, it is almost impossible to build a software task without great expertise on the tool. 

Maven:
Maven although similar to Gratle, is a management tool that is also mostly used on Java. And since Maven is a management tool it can also be used on other platforms and it's managed by Apache software.
